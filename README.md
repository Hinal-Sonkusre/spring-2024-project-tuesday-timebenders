# Me, Myself and Time
It's a 2D-platformer game with a unique time-travel mechanic! In this game, players can create copies of their past selves to assist in navigating increasingly challenging levels, strategic planning is key. The game also features obstacles like spikes and pits, along with collectibles that grant special abilities such as dashing and time-freezing. Every move counts as you aim to complete levels with the highest score!
